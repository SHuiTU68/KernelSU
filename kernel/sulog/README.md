# The su audit log

`kernel/sulog/` records the root grants the module hands out and streams them to one
privileged userspace reader over a file that has no path. Three small pieces: a producer
API that snapshots task identity and the `execve` arguments ([`event.c`](event.c)), a
readable file a daemon polls ([`fd.c`](fd.c)), and an on/off switch wired into the feature
registry ([`../feature/sulog.c`](../feature/sulog.c)). Two headers carry everything the
directory exports inward: [`event.h`](event.h) declares the capture and emit calls,
`ksu_sulog_get_queue()` and `ksu_sulog_events_init()`/`_exit()`, while [`fd.h`](fd.h)
declares `ksu_install_sulog_fd()` and the fd layer's own init and exit. The transport
underneath is generic and lives in [`../infra/event_queue.c`](../infra/event_queue.c);
sulog is its only consumer in the tree. Nothing here writes to disk: at most 256 records
sit in RAM, and once that many are queued every further record is thrown away. Persistence
belongs to `ksud sulogd`
([`../../userspace/ksud/src/sulog.rs`](../../userspace/ksud/src/sulog.rs)).

## Who emits, and why capture and emit are two calls

Three call sites produce records, and only three, but two of them now stand behind a pair
of syscalls. `ksu_hook_execve_common()` in
[`../hook/syscall_event_bridge.c`](../hook/syscall_event_bridge.c) captures a
`ROOT_EXECVE` whenever `current_euid().val == 0`; `ksu_hook_execve()` and
`ksu_hook_execveat()` are one-line wrappers over it, and both are registered in
[`../hook/syscall_hook_manager.c`](../hook/syscall_hook_manager.c), because a recent
bionic implements `execve()` on top of `execveat(AT_FDCWD, path, argv, envp, 0)` and a
hook on `__NR_execve` alone would watch a syscall the C library has stopped issuing. The
`execveat` flag threaded through the common function picks the execveat variant of each
handler that has one - the ksud bootstrap hook, the adb-root path, sucompat - but for
capture it does nothing except move the argument window: the pathname pointer is
`PT_REGS_PARM1` for `execve` and `PT_REGS_PARM2` for `execveat`, with argv one register
further along in each case, and capture needs both pointers before the address space is
replaced. `ksu_handle_execve_sucompat_common()` in
[`../feature/sucompat.c`](../feature/sucompat.c) captures a `SUCOMPAT` after installing
the `O_PATH` descriptor for ksud and before rewriting the syscall registers, reached the
same way from `ksu_handle_execve_sucompat()` and `ksu_handle_execveat_sucompat()`.
`do_grant_root()` in [`../supercall/dispatch.c`](../supercall/dispatch.c) calls
`ksu_sulog_emit_grant_root()` with the uid and euid it snapshotted before
`escape_with_root_profile()` ran.

An `execveat` that reaches the sucompat handler is narrowed before anything is logged.
Interception works by overwriting the syscall's registers into
`execveat(ksud_fd, "", argv, envp, AT_EMPTY_PATH)`, which cannot be layered on top of a
caller that already meant something by the dirfd or the flags, so the handler jumps to
`do_orig_execve` unless `(int)PT_REGS_PARM1(regs)` is `AT_FDCWD` and
`(int)PT_REGS_PARM5(regs)` is zero. An `su` invoked as
`execveat(fd, "", ..., AT_EMPTY_PATH)` therefore passes through untouched and yields no
`SUCOMPAT` record, though a caller already at euid 0 still produces the `ROOT_EXECVE` one.

The execve sites call `ksu_sulog_capture_root_execve()` / `ksu_sulog_capture_sucompat()`,
which return an opaque `struct ksu_sulog_pending_event *`, and later
`ksu_sulog_emit_pending()` with the result. The two halves of a record are readable at
different instants: before the syscall, `filename_user` and `argv_user` point into the
caller's address space but the outcome is unknown; after a successful `execve` that
address space has been replaced, so the same pointers name the new image's memory. One
shot afterwards logs garbage for exactly the events that matter most; one shot beforehand
gives every record `retval = 0`. `retval` therefore means something different per type:
the real syscall's return value for `ROOT_EXECVE`, but the return value of
`escape_with_root_profile()` for `SUCOMPAT` (emitted before
`ksu_syscall_table[__NR_execveat]()` runs, so zero means the escalation succeeded, not
that the program did) and for `IOCTL_GRANT_ROOT`. Only `event_type` says which reading
applies; nothing on `retval` itself does. One syscall can yield two records: a process
already at euid 0 that execs `/system/bin/su` trips the euid test and then falls into the
sucompat branch, capturing again.

Capture reads user memory with `strncpy_from_user_nofault()` rather than
`strncpy_from_user()`, which runs with page faults disabled, so a bad or non-resident
pointer fails immediately instead of dragging the fault handler and `mmap_lock` into a
best-effort log path. Atomic context is not the reason:
`ksu_handle_execve_sucompat_common()` calls plain `strncpy_from_user()` on the same
filename pointer a few lines earlier, and both execve producers pass `GFP_KERNEL`. The
filename and each argument string also pass through `untagged_addr()` to strip the arm64
top-byte-ignore / MTE tag; the argv vector itself is read with `get_user()` on the
pointer exactly as the caller supplied it. The argv walker mirrors `fs/exec.c`'s
`struct user_arg_ptr` union, but its compat branch is unreachable:
`ksu_sys_enter_handler()` in
[`../hook/syscall_hook_manager.c`](../hook/syscall_hook_manager.c) - the `sys_enter`
handler that redirects hooked syscalls into the dispatcher - returns before the redirect
for `in_compat_syscall()` on x86_64 and `is_compat_task()` on arm64, so no 32-bit command
line is logged.

## Record and frame layout

The payload is `struct ksu_sulog_event` in [`../../uapi/sulog.h`](../../uapi/sulog.h):

```c
struct ksu_sulog_event {
    __u16 version;
    __u16 event_type;
    __s32 retval;
    __u32 pid;
    __u32 tgid;
    __u32 ppid;
    __u32 uid;
    __u32 euid;
    char comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];
    __u32 filename_len;
    __u32 argv_len;
} __packed;
```

That is 52 bytes, and the filename and the flattened argv follow it, each NUL-terminated
and each length counting its NUL. `__packed` buys nothing today: every member is
fixed-width, none needs more than four-byte alignment, and the natural layout already has
no padding on a 32- or a 64-bit build. It is there to pin the layout against whatever
field gets added later, which matters because `ksud` reparses the bytes as a hand-written
`#[repr(C, packed)] SulogEventHeader` rather than as bindgen output. `comm` must stay
exactly `TASK_COMM_LEN`, since `get_task_comm()` carries a `BUILD_BUG_ON` on the
destination size. `KSU_SULOG_EVENT_VERSION` is stamped into every record and is currently
1. The frame is `struct ksu_event_record_hdr` in
[`../infra/event_queue.h`](../infra/event_queue.h): 24 bytes of
`{type, flags, len, seq, ts_ns}` emitted verbatim ahead of every payload. `seq` starts at
1 and is assigned under the queue lock, so it counts events produced, including those
lost; `ts_ns` is `ktime_get_ns()`, i.e. CLOCK_MONOTONIC. Type `0xFFFF`
(`KSU_EVENT_QUEUE_TYPE_DROPPED`) is reserved for the loss marker below. Capture puts the
header, filename and argv in one 2048-byte allocation, so the variable-length part has a
single lifetime; the only other allocation is the small `struct ksu_sulog_pending_event`
that carries it, and `ksu_sulog_free_pending()` releases both. Only the bytes used are
pushed, so a grant-root record carries a 54-byte payload, 78 bytes once the frame header
in front of it is counted.

## What a full buffer does

Despite the "ring buffer" reflex, [`../infra/event_queue.c`](../infra/event_queue.c) holds
a bounded linked list: a `struct list_head pending` of kmalloc'd nodes, appended at the
tail and removed from the head. When it is full the *new* event is dropped and the old
ones are kept; there is no overwrite-oldest path. `ksu_event_queue_push()` builds the node
before taking `queue->lock`, so the spinlock covers only the insertion and the sequence
bump. If the allocation failed, or `queued >= max_queued` (256), it calls
`ksu_event_queue_note_drop_locked(queue, seq)` instead of linking and returns `-ENOMEM` or
`-ENOSPC`; `ksu_sulog_capture()`'s `out_drop` label calls `ksu_event_queue_drop()`
directly, so a capture-time failure is accounted the same way. Producers never wait for
the reader: an audit log that could stall an `execve` would be worse than one that loses
records. They can still sleep in the allocator, since both execve sites pass `GFP_KERNEL`,
but nothing in the path blocks on a slow or absent consumer.

Losses are reported, not hidden. `dropped_pending`, `dropped_first_seq` and
`dropped_last_seq` accumulate, and the reader's next `read()` gets a synthetic record of
type `0xFFFF` with `KSU_EVENT_RECORD_FLAG_INTERNAL` set, carrying
`struct ksu_event_queue_dropped_info { dropped, first_seq, last_seq }`. Naming the range
lets a reader say which records are missing, not merely that some are.
`ksu_event_queue_read_drop()` dances around one hazard: the counters must be cleared under
the spinlock, since a producer can bump them at any instant, but `copy_to_user()` may
fault and sleep and cannot run under one. It moves the values into `dropped_inflight*` and
zeroes the live ones before dropping the lock; on a faulting copy `out_restore` folds them
back, keeping the earlier `first_seq`. `ksu_event_queue_has_data_locked()` counts
`dropped_inflight` too, so `poll()` still reports readable while a drop record is owed.
Without that staging, one faulting copy would erase the evidence that anything was lost.
The record path has the mirror-image constraint: `ksu_event_queue_read_node()` reads the
head node's length under the lock, releases it, copies the bytes out, and only then
unlinks with `list_del()` and frees. Touching an unlocked node that way is safe because
`ksu_event_queue_read()` holds the `read_lock` mutex across the whole call, so a second
thread that shares or dup'd the descriptor cannot reach the same head node. A faulting
copy leaves the node at the head and returns `-EFAULT` with nothing lost.

## The file handed to the reader

`ksu_install_sulog_fd()` calls
`anon_inode_getfile("[ksu_sulog]", &ksu_sulog_fops, NULL, O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC)` and
`fd_install()`s the result. An anonymous inode is a `struct file` with custom
`file_operations` and no filesystem entry, the construction behind `eventfd` and
`perf_event_open`; it surfaces only as `anon_inode:[ksu_sulog]` in the holder's
`/proc/<pid>/fd`. That is the point. A `/proc` node would be a named, enumerable object
every process can stat, and would need a `genfscon` label plus policy to be reachable from
`u:r:ksu:s0` - one more visible artefact for a project that spends its other half hiding
them. A netlink socket would need a globally registered family number and would still
appear in `/proc/net/netlink`. The module already owns an ioctl control plane on the
`[ksu_driver]` anon inode ([`../supercall/supercall.c`](../supercall/supercall.c)), so a
second anon-inode fd costs nothing new.

`ksu_sulog_fops` exposes `read`, `poll`, `release` and `noop_llseek`, and no
`unlocked_ioctl`: a leaked sulog descriptor grants the ability to watch the audit stream,
not to command the module. `.owner = THIS_MODULE` pins the module while a descriptor is
open, keeping `ksu_event_queue_destroy()` from freeing nodes under an in-flight `read()`.
Exactly one descriptor exists at a time - `ksu_sulog_fd_active` under `ksu_sulog_fd_lock`
fails a second request with `-EBUSY` - because reads are destructive and two readers would
split the stream. Userspace asks with `KSU_IOCTL_GET_SULOG_FD`, declared in
[`../../uapi/supercall.h`](../../uapi/supercall.h) as
`_IOW('K', 20, struct ksu_get_sulog_fd_cmd)`. `do_get_sulog_fd()` rejects a non-zero value
in the reserved `flags` word with `-EINVAL`, which makes a future variant addable without
a new ioctl number; a request after teardown gets `-EPIPE`. The fd number is the ioctl's
return value rather than a struct field, so no second `copy_to_user()` can fault after
installation and leak it. The table pins the command to `only_root`
([`../supercall/perm.c`](../supercall/perm.c)), not `manager_or_root`: the stream carries
every root exec on the device, command lines included.

## The switch and the daemon behind it

[`../feature/sulog.c`](../feature/sulog.c) registers `sulog_handler` with
[`../policy/feature.c`](../policy/feature.c) as `KSU_FEATURE_SULOG` (id 2 in
[`../../uapi/feature.h`](../../uapi/feature.h)), backed by one
`static bool ksu_sulog_enabled __read_mostly` defaulting to false. The test lives inside
`ksu_sulog_capture()`, not at the hook sites, so a disabled log costs one bool read per
root `execve`. There is no Kconfig symbol; `sulog/event.o`, `sulog/fd.o`,
`feature/sulog.o` and `infra/event_queue.o` are all listed unconditionally in
[`../Kbuild`](../Kbuild). Flipping the bit is not enough, because something has to drain
the queue. `set_kernel_feature()` in
[`../../userspace/ksud/src/feature.rs`](../../userspace/ksud/src/feature.rs) calls
`sulog::ensure_sulogd_running()` whenever the feature is set non-zero, which double-forks
and re-execs `/proc/self/exe sulogd`. That daemon takes an exclusive `flock` on
`/data/adb/ksu/sulogd.lock` and exits quietly if another instance holds it, so the spawn
is idempotent. `init_features()` replays `/data/adb/ksu/.feature_config` at post-fs-data,
which is how the daemon returns after a reboot. That file stores each setting under the
numeric feature id rather than the name, which makes the id an ABI of its own:
renumbering `KSU_FEATURE_SULOG` would make a saved sulog bit come back as some other
feature's. Upstream allocates ids upward from zero and has since taken 5 for
`KSU_FEATURE_WEBVIEW_ZYGOTE_UMOUNT`, which is why this fork's own features now start at
16; sulog kept id 2 across that, and `parse_feature_id()` in
[`../../userspace/ksud/src/feature.rs`](../../userspace/ksud/src/feature.rs) still
resolves both `sulog` and `2` onto `FeatureId::Sulog`.

`run_sulog_session()` opens the stream through `open_sulog_fd()`, which calls
`ksucalls::get_sulog_fd()`
([`../../userspace/ksud/src/ksucalls.rs`](../../userspace/ksud/src/ksucalls.rs)) and
switches the descriptor to `O_NONBLOCK` with an `F_GETFL`/`F_SETFL` pair - which is what
selects `-EAGAIN` over sleeping, since `ksu_sulog_read()` passes `file->f_flags` through.
The session then epolls it. Its 8192-byte buffer exceeds the 2072-byte maximum frame, and
that matters: a buffer smaller than the head record makes `ksu_event_queue_read_node()`
return `-EMSGSIZE` forever. Frames are decoded by testing for `0xFFFF` first and otherwise
checking `size_of::<SulogEventHeader>() + filename_len + argv_len == payload.len()`, so a
layout drift becomes a skipped record, not an out-of-bounds slice. Lines land in
`/data/adb/ksu/log/sulog-YYYY-MM-DD[-N].log`, mode 0600 in a 0700 directory, as
`key=value` text flushed per line, with backslash, quote and control-character escaping on
every quoted field. `argv` is attacker-controlled, and an unescaped newline would let a
logged process forge log lines. Retention and rotation come from the module-config store
under module id `internal.ksud.sulogd`: `log.retention.days` (default 3) and
`log.max_file_size` (default 10 MiB). The manager never opens the kernel fd - there is no
JNI binding for it. It flips the feature with `execKsud("feature set sulog ...")` in
[`SettingsRepositoryImpl.kt`](../../manager/app/src/main/java/me/weishu/kernelsu/data/repository/SettingsRepositoryImpl.kt)
and tails the rotated files through libsu's `SuFile` and `SuFileInputStream` in
[`SulogHelper.kt`](../../manager/app/src/main/java/me/weishu/kernelsu/ui/util/SulogHelper.kt).

## Startup and teardown order

`ksu_sulog_init()` runs from [`../core/init.c`](../core/init.c) immediately after
`ksu_feature_init()`, because the handler table has to exist, and before
`ksu_supercalls_init()`, because `GET_SULOG_FD` must not be reachable before the queue is
initialised. `ksu_sulog_exit()` runs in phase 2 of `kernelsu_exit()`, after the syscall
hooks and the supercall driver are gone and after `synchronize_rcu()`: producers must be
silenced before the list they append to is dismantled. Teardown is itself ordered.
`ksu_sulog_fd_exit()` clears the single-instance flag and calls `ksu_event_queue_close()`,
which sets `closed` under the lock and wakes every waiter with `EPOLLHUP`; only then does
`ksu_sulog_events_exit()` reach `ksu_event_queue_destroy()`, which takes `read_lock`
before freeing nodes so it cannot race a reader mid-`copy_to_user()`. Setting `closed`
first turns a blocked `wait_event_interruptible` into a clean EOF instead of leaving a
task parked on a wait queue about to disappear. To the daemon that is a zero-length read;
the session ends and `run_sulogd()` retries three seconds later, by which time the ioctl
fails.

## Known limits

Records produced during teardown vanish without a marker: `ksu_event_queue_push()` on a
closed queue returns `-EPIPE` before consuming a sequence number or noting a drop.
Disabling the feature neither drains nor closes the queue and does not stop `sulogd`;
there is no flush, reset or resize. Nothing enforces that the holder of `[ksu_sulog]` is
ksud, so any root process can take it first and starve the daemon.
`KSU_SULOG_EVENT_VERSION` is stamped into every record but no consumer branches on it, and
sequence numbers restart at 1 on module reload rather than on reboot, so the daemon's
`boot_id` marker is the only fence.

Reading user memory without faulting has a cost the record does not admit to. A string
that is swapped out or not yet faulted in makes `strncpy_from_user_nofault()` fail, and
both `ksu_sulog_copy_filename()` and `ksu_sulog_flatten_argv()` fall back to
`ksu_sulog_copy_empty_string()` when it does, so the record goes out with a blank `file`
or a blank `argv` and nothing marks the difference between a program invoked with no
arguments and one whose arguments could not be read. Truncation is silent in the same way:
the filename is capped at 256 bytes, each argument at 256 bytes by the `arg` chunk buffer,
and the flattened command line at whatever is left of the 2048-byte payload. The
`execveat` capture adds a third source of blanks that is nobody's fault: a caller that
names its program by descriptor passes an empty pathname with `AT_EMPTY_PATH`, so the
record copies a legitimately empty string and prints the same `file=""` as a read that
faulted. A relative pathname under a real dirfd loses its anchor for the same reason:
`execveat(dirfd, "prog", argv, envp, 0)` from a euid-0 caller logs `file="prog"` and the
record has no field for the descriptor the name is relative to. Nothing else in the record
names the program either: `comm` is filled during capture and still holds the caller's
name, not the image about to replace it. The syscall goes unnamed as well: with bionic
routing `execve()` through `execveat` and both numbers hooked, `ROOT_EXECVE` records now
mix the two, and separating them would take a new field and a `KSU_SULOG_EVENT_VERSION`
bump that no consumer reads yet.
